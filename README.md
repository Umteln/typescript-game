#### Word Filler - TypeScript Game

Word Filler is my version of the well-known "hangman game". In this game, words are randomly generated. Players have the ability to guess a letter to try and fill in the full correct word. The goal is to guess all of the letters in the word. If the player is unable to guess correctly,  part of the image will appear on the screen. The player loses if the image is complete and the word blanks are not filled in.
